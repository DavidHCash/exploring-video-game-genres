        These games often recreate real-world rules, teams, athletes, and
        stadiums to deliver an authentic feel. Many titles include advanced
        physics engines that model ball movement, player momentum, and
        collisions to make gameplay more realistic. Players typically manage
        individual athletes or entire teams, making strategic decisions such as
        formations, plays, and substitutions. Career and franchise modes add
        depth by letting players build teams, develop athletes, and manage
        long-term progress.
