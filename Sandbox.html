        Instead of following a strictly guided storyline or completing linear
        missions, players can choose their own goals, interact with the
        environment in creative ways, and often modify or build within the game
        world. They will typically feature open worlds, flexible systems, and
        tools that let players craft unique experiences—whether that means
        constructing buildings, customizing characters, creating stories, or
        simply exploring at their own pace.
