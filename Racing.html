        They capture the excitement of high-speed driving, testing players’
        reflexes, precision, and ability to handle different vehicles and track
        conditions. Whether rooted in realistic physics or designed with
        arcade-style simplicity, racing games challenge players to outmaneuver
        opponents, perfect cornering techniques, and push for the fastest
        possible times. Many titles also feature vehicle customization,
        progression systems, and multiplayer modes that deepen the competitive
        experience.

          <strong>Forza Horizon 5:</strong> delivers an open-world racing
          experience set across a vast, visually stunning environment, combining
          realistic driving physics with arcade-style fun. Players can switch
          between dozens of cars, customize performance and style, and race

          and multiplayer fun make it ideal for casual and competitive play
          alike, offering both solo and party-style races that are easy to pick
