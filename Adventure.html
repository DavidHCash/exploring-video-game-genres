        The adventure game genre centers on exploration, storytelling, and
        puzzle-solving, inviting players to immerse themselves in richly
        detailed worlds filled with mystery and discovery. These games often
        emphasize narrative depth over fast-paced action, encouraging players to
        interact with characters, uncover secrets, and make meaningful choices
        that influence the story’s outcome. From classic point-and-click
        adventures to modern cinematic experiences, adventure games captivate
        players with their engaging plots, memorable settings, and
        thought-provoking challenges.
