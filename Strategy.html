        effective course of action.

      <p>
        Strategy titles often involve building economies, gathering resources,
        researching upgrades, and deploying units or structures with specific
        strengths and weaknesses. Many games also require players to adapt to
        changing conditions—such as enemy behavior, shifting terrain, or limited
        supplies—while maintaining long-term goals. Whether turn-based or
        real-time, strategy games reward creativity, patience, and the ability
        to think several steps ahead.
