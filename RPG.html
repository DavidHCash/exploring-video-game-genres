        In RPGs, players take on the roles of one or more characters,
        progressing through quests, battles, and exploration while gaining
        experience points to improve their abilities or equipment. These games
        often feature detailed worlds, branching narratives, and systems for
        dialogue, inventory, and skill progression that allow players to shape
        their own journey.
